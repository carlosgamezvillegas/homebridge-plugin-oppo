# What is this?

Control your Oppo 203 from your iOS Device.

This is my first plugin for Homebridge. It needs a lot of work and hopefully I will be able to make it work better in the future. As of now, to make it work you have to do the following:

1. Enable IP control on your Oppo 203/205. Setup>Network Setup> IP Control:On
2. Set the Oppo to Network. Setup>Device Setup> Standby Mode:Network Standby
3. Change the OPPO_IP in the index.js file to the IP address of your Oppo. Find the installation folder Homebridge-oppo-203/dist/index.js.
This will change in the future, I need to lear how to get the value from the config file.
4. Make sure to turn on the Oppo before setting homebridge, this is necessary to put the Oppo on VERBOSE MODE 2.

If you have any modificagtions and improvements please let know.

Enjoy!!
